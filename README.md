# HubRise TinyTablet

TinyTablet is a minimalistic browser-based app, that shows how you can write an app connected to Deliveroo, Uber Eats, and dozens of other apps, in a few lines of code.

TinyTablet first asks you to connect to HubRise, then it displays the latest orders received by your HubRise location, including order details.

All the code is in `index.html` and `js/app.js`, which amount to less than 250 lines, including the HTML and the code of the HubRise integration! There is no server code.

Feel free to use this code as a guide when you implement your own solution for HubRise, or to fork this repository and improve the app, just for fun.

## Try the app

First, you need to [create a HubRise account](https://manager.hubrise.com/signup). It's free and it only takes a minute. 

Then, simply [open the app](https://tiny-tablet.hubrise-apps.com) in your browser. 

You will be asked to connect the app to your HubRise account. Granting permissions is a necessary step in every OAuth2.0 authentication process, and requires the user to manually **Allow** the app access.

As this is a demo app with no server side code, you will also need to run a command in a terminal with `curl` installed to create your access token. In a real app, this would not be needed, as the token would be created automatically by the server.

You will then see a single-page app that displays the list of the latest orders received by your HubRise location. 
Each line in the logs displays the time, id, status, and total price of the order.

Clicking on one of the logs reveals additional information about the order, such as the customer's details and the purchased products.

### Sending orders to HubRise (optional)

If you want to send new orders to HubRise, you need a separate app. You can find the detailed steps of how to set up a new app in the [Quick start guide](https://www.hubrise.com/developers/quick-start).

Alternatively, if you want to quickly send an order to HubRise, follow these steps.

1. Copy and paste in your browser the following url: `https://manager.hubrise.com/oauth2/v1/authorize?redirect_uri=urn:ietf:wg:oauth:2.0:oob&client_id=910639589600.clients.hubrise.com&scope=location[orders.write]`
1. **Allow** the app to access your location.
1. Copy the authorisation code. 
1. Substitute your authorisation code and send the following request from the command line:
   ```
   curl -X POST 'https://manager.hubrise.com/oauth2/v1/token?code=YOUR_AUTHORISATION_CODE&client_id=910639589600.clients.hubrise.com&client_secret=15336ea38512c92bab50e519ee29818875430301a9f21adb0525b3d01944648f'
   ```
1. You should obtain a JSON object that looks like this:
   ```
   {"access_token":"qwerty1234567890","account_id":"wbv7z","location_id":"wbv7z-0","catalog_id":"wj9rj","customer_list_id":"wx77p"}
   ```
   Copy the access token.
1. Substitute your access token, replace `EUR` with your location's currency if needed, and send the following request from the command line:
   ```
   curl -H 'X-Access-Token: YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN' \
   -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
   -X POST 'https://api.hubrise.com/v1/location/orders' \
   -d '{
     "status": "new",
     "customer": {
       "first_name": "Julie",
       "last_name": "Brown"
     },
     "items": [
       {
         "product_name": "Pizza"
         "quantity": "1",
         "price": "11.90 EUR",
       }
     ]
   }'
   ```
1. Click "Refresh" on the TinyTablet page and you should see the new order.

## What this app is NOT

This app is not production ready! It is intended to be used by developers for educational purposes.

This app includes certain practices that should not be used in production environments. For example, the client secret is published in the client code, which is a security risk. In a production environment, you would create access tokens from your server to protect your client secret.

## Running TinyTablet locally

TinyTablet is a Web app with no server code. To run it locally, you just need a static file server.

If you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed on your machine, you can use `serve` for this purpose.

From the project's folder, run:
```
sudo npm install -g serve
serve
```

Then open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000`.
